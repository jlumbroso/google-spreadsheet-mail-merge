# Google Spreadsheet Mail Merge

This is a template for a simple Python script that takes **a list of emails and names** from a Google Spreadsheet and sends **a personalized email** to each person using SendGrid.

The typical use case for which it was designed was in the context of higher education, either to send personalized emails to conference attendants or research subjects.

The template relies entirely on APIs that have **free tiers** ü§ë, and can be run either locally or in a GitHub Codespace.

The example in this template uses [this public Google Spreadsheet with fictitious information](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ASvG2maFz0Jw9qk44PktzTWjS6Grxdvj_S4NiyIxCTE/edit#gid=0), and the emails are sent to [a publically accessible inbox on MailSAC `google-spreadsheet-mail-merge@mailsac.com`](https://mailsac.com/inbox/google-spreadsheet-mail-merge-test@mailsac.com) which you can check out to see sample emails.

_If this template is useful to you, üåü start the repository on GitHub to show your support!_ ü§©üòä

## üö† Overview

The recommended steps to use this template are:

- Follow the **üß∞ Initial Setup** instructions below to create your own repository, obtain Google Spreadsheet and Twilio SendGrid API keys, and configure everything needed to launch a GitHub Codespace.
- Edit the `notebook.ipynb` file to adapt the script to your needs:
  - Change the Google Spreadsheet ID and worksheet index to your own spreadsheet in the **üìù TODO: Customize this part of the notebook** section of the notebook.
  - Create email templates and add them to the `./templates` subfolder.
  - Write the logic to determine, for each contact, which template to use and how to customize it, by editing the **ü™Ñ TODO: Actual logic of how to customize emails** section of the notebook.
- Send the emails!

If you are unfamiliar with GitHub and/or are new to programming, you may find it useful to know that:

- You can [add files to your repository directly from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository)
- You can [modify the notebook directly from GitHub Codespace by committing your changes to the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-source-control-in-your-codespace#committing-your-changes).

## üß∞ Initial Setup

ü™™ Before proceeding, [**register** a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one.

### 1. ‚ú® Create your own repository

You first need to create your own copy of this "Google Spreadsheet Mail Merge" repository, so that you can configure the API keys, but also so you adapt the script to your needs.

You can **instantiate** this template repository [by clicking the green "Use this template" button above](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

### 2. üîê Obtain Google Spreadsheet API access

Although Google Spreadsheet API is free to use for basic usage, Google requires you to have an account setup: [Create a project](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/oauth2.html#enable-api-access-for-a-project) and enable API access, then [obtain service account credentials](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/oauth2.html#for-bots-using-service-account).

Save the `service_accounts.json` file locally in the root of this project (because the filename is in `.gitignore`, it will not be committed to the repository).

To be able to operate this project from GitHub Codespaces: [Create an encrypted GitHub Codespaces secret](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-codespaces) `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` with the the contents of the `service_accounts.json` file.

_Note: If you do not want to use Google Spreadsheets, you could also read the data from a CSV file._

### 3. üìß Get a Twilio SendGrid account

Next you need to get a SendGrid account to send emails. You can [sign up for a free SendGrid account](https://signup.sendgrid.com/).

Once you have an account, you can [obtain a SendGrid API key](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) (read more on [how to get started with the SendGrid API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/api-getting-started)).

Create a `.env` file at the root of this project and add the following line:

```bash
SENDGRID_API_KEY=...
```

Additionally, [create an encrypted GitHub Codespaces secret](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-codespaces) `SENDGRID_API_KEY` with the SendGrid API key.

_Note: SendGrid is a market leader, and is a great, cost-effective choice for sending emails. However, if you want to use a different email provider, you can easily replace the SendGrid code with code for your provider._

### 4. üöÄ Launch the Codespace and code!

Now you can [launch a GitHub Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository) for your repository and start coding ‚Äî¬†almost everything is automated.

When opening the Jupyter notebook (currently `notebook.ipynb`, but you might create other notebooks), you will need to [select the appropriate Jupyter kernel](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_create-or-open-a-jupyter-notebook) in VS Code.

On GitHub Codespaces, this kernel will be called `google-spreadsheet-mail-merge`.

If you are developing locally, you first need to install the Python dependencies and create your own Jupyter kernel. You can do so using `pipenv`:

```bash
pipenv sync --dev
pipenv run python -m ipykernel install --name='google-spreadsheet-mail-merge' --display-name='google-spreadsheet-mail-merge'
```
